# System Design Playbook

Concise, no-code system design notes and problem-cards. Minimal and practical: only three focused modules to avoid clutter.

Modules (only three)
- 01-basics — Core concepts and quick glossary.
- 02-everyday-backend-patterns — Common operations we do in apps (auth, uploads, notifications, search, queues, etc.).
- 03-interview-questions — Curated system-design interview prompts (easy / medium / hard) with hints and trade-offs.

Repository goal
- Minimal, focused, and practical: each module is intentionally short (single README per module).

Description: System design reference covering how big companies handle real problems, adaptive video delivery, and global scaling patterns. No code — just patterns, trade-offs, and references.
